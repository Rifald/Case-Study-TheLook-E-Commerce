# Study Case LookUp E-Commerce

Documentation of a case study on bigquery data called TheLook E-Commerce. I did this Case Study when I was taking a Mini Course at RevoU.
In the case study, there are 3 tables that can be analyzed
1. Orders table : records all the orders placed by the customer
2. Order_items table : records the list of the items purchased in every order ID.
3. Products table : records the details of the products sold on The Look, including the price, brand, and product categories
