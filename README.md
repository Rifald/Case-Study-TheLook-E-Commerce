# Study Case LookUp E-Commerce

Documentation of a case study on bigquery data called TheLook E-Commerce. I did this Case Study when I was taking a Mini Course at RevoU.
In the case study, there are 3 tables that can be analyzed
1. Orders table : records all the orders placed by the customer
2. Order_items table : records the list of the items purchased in every order ID.
3. Products table : records the details of the products sold on The Look, including the price, brand, and product categories

### Ask
The first step, I determine what things can be analyzed to help solve problems that exist in the company
1. How is the development of sales monthly at the company?
2. How to increase sales?

### Prepare
To answer the question, I saw and analyzed from 3 tables, what data can be taken from the three tables to answer the question

### Analyze
After determining what data is needed, I implement it using <a href="https://github.com/Rifald/Study-Case-TheLook-E-Commerce/blob/main/Query/query.sql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a> to get the required data. After that I make a visualization using Data Studio based on the data that has been taken
